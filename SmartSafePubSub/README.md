> ### SmartSafePubNub
<p align="justify">Safety is always a concern in our society. With the help of technology we can help people and find a way to keep our loved ones safe by tracking them at any time. Developing a mobile application that publishes the current location of a person to another device that subscribes for a response (location information). The phone GPS or mobile network is used to retrieve the Geo-location. With such an app, the personâ€™s current location can be visualized in maps in any device. My App needs to be installed in two or more devices. One device will get the current location and publish the geo-location information (latitude and longitude) to the PubNub channel. Other devices which subscribes the channel will receive this geo-location in real-time and pass it to the Google API which in-turn returns the exact location of the person to the Map Activity. </p>
